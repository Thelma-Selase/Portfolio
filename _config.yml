About me: I am a Financial Data Analyst who applies statistical and quantitative methods to solve complex problems in finance and risk. I specialize in credit risk modelling, time-series forecasting, and financial analytics using Python and SQL to drive clear, data-backed decisions.

My work focuses on turning raw financial data into actionable insight, building robust models, and asking the right questions that inform strategy—not just reports. This portfolio reflects my commitment to rigor, impact, and continuous growth toward high-level roles in fintech, investment, and financial services.
