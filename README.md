I am a Financial Data Analyst who applies statistical and quantitative methods to solve complex problems in finance and risk. I specialize in credit risk modelling, time-series forecasting, and financial analytics, using Python and SQL to drive clear, data-backed decisions. 

My work focuses on turning raw financial data into actionable insight, building robust models, and asking the right questions that inform strategy, not just reports. Whether the challenge is risk assessment, forecasting, or financial performance analysis, I deliver insights that enable you to act with confidence, improve financial outcomes, and maximize ROI.
